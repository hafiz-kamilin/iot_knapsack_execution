[Smart Tomato Farm Problem]

    Tomato farm is divided into 10 areas which have it own exclusive sprinkler (1 area 1 sprinkler). We
    assume the sprinkler can freely adjust the irrigation area based on the sprinkler head. now
    the problem is the water tank can only support 40 L/min of total irrigation output (in 
    other words we can't execute the all sprinklers at the same time), and there is 
    a list of sprinklers to be choosen from. How to simplify this problems?

    #####################
    # 0 # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 #
    #####################   Area partition
    # 5 # 6 # 7 # 8 # 9 #
    #####################

    To solve this problem, we will imagine our sprinkler execution sequence as a knapsack problem.

        1. Imagine sprinkler output specification and (output specification)/cost as item weight
           and value.
        2. Imagine supported water tank output as knapsack weight limit.
        3. Based on the knapsack weight limit, find the item(s) that need to be included and
           minus selected items with the number of area partition. This will be our first
           round of executions.
        4. Repeat step 3 for the second, third and so on for the execution round until the
           number of area partition is 0.

    From the hard coded sprinklers selection, we will get;

        ROUND 1: [('sprinkler_01', 10, 5), ('sprinkler_02', 10, 5), ('sprinkler_07', 9, 2), ('sprinkler_16', 10, 5)]
        ROUND 2: [('sprinkler_05', 13, 4), ('sprinkler_11', 13, 3), ('sprinkler_19', 13, 6)]
        ROUND 3: [('sprinkler_03', 20, 6), ('sprinkler_20', 18, 3)]
        ROUND 4: [('sprinkler_15', 15, 3)]

    which mean, this program choose the best value versus specification we can get and at the same time
    it arrange the sprinklers order of execution to abide the water tank output specification.
