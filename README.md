This is an example concept that show IoT device's execution order can be scheduled while adhere to the single resource constraint by arranging the execution in parallel, sequence or the combination of it (basically imagining scheduling problem as a repeating knapsack problem). this is an extension research based on [Auto-Scheduling based on Linear Programming Method](https://github.com/hafiz-kamilin/iot_auto_scheduling).

## Test run

Assuming Python 3 programming environment already configured by the user; execute `smartfarm_problem.py`.
