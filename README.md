This is an example concept that show IoT device's execution order can be automated while adhere the system cap by arranging the execution in parallel, sequence or the combination of it. this is an extension research on [Auto-Scheduling based on Linear Programming Method](https://github.com/hafiz-kamilin/iot_auto_scheduling).

## Test run

Assuming Python 3 programming environment already configured by the user; execute `smartfarm_problem.py`.
